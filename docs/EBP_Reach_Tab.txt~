Create Admin Tab for EBP Reach

Backend
  design API
    requirement:
      data for 2 tables,
        EBP Counts of PCT Tracking template types
          NATIONAL
          VISN
          STATION
        EBP Counts of EBP Reach from PCT Tracking template types Plus Other templates
    routines
      admin_page_ebp - main routine to collect all data
        admin_page_ebp_national - compute national data
        admin_page_ebp_visn - compute VISN data
        admin_page_ebp_facility - compute facility data
      or
      admin_page_ebp - perl to run all 3 sql reports and combine into nested json
        generate one json dataset for all three tables
        write js to parse the nested json object
      EBP Counts of PCT Tracking template types
    format
      admin_page_ebp
    define domain and parameters
      domain = ebp_reach
      dtrng - fix dates to start
    Alpha Version
      output just one table of data (due to length of time to run the query)
      table contains all station output -Reach and EBP Counts
        combines reach data with individual EBP counts
      ?? NATIONAL/VISN -- should we allow specific VISN selection or default VISN output to all VISNs
    Issue to Address!!
      Ask Kelly if we should include all EBPs or PTSD EBPs only
      - EBPFlag -- are we using the ebp flag to get ebp from all templates?
      - PTSDEBPflag -- should we use this flag

Frontend
  (use Admin MBC page as a model)
  create page component
  add tab link on sidebar
  store - state, actions, getters
  remember FRESH_ALL entry for EBP Reach page
